# üìú Introduction
The script offers a robust solution for analyzing and visualizing events from Suricata, a widely-used open-source Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (NIDS/NIPS). 
It is tailored for professional security consultants to evaluate and produce an all-inclusive report of security events recorded by the Suricata system.

The script processes event data from a JSON file, filters out specified excluded messages, and generates visual representations using bar and pie charts. 
Additionally, it creates tables displaying the top 10 source IPs, top 10 alert messages, and unique IPs associated with each alert message.

This information is then assembled into an HTML report, which is saved as a file.

Key functionalities of the script encompass:

-    Reading and sorting event data from a JSON file.
-    Generating a bar chart for the top 10 source IPs.
-    Producing a pie chart for the distribution of top 10 alert messages.
-    Creating tables for the top 10 source IPs, top 10 alert messages, and unique IPs per alert message.
-    Compiling the charts and tables into an HTML report.
-    Saving the report to a file.

The script employs various libraries, such as pandas, Plotly, and tqdm, to effectively process and visualize the data. 
The resulting report equips security consultants with valuable insights, facilitating the identification of potential security threats and prioritization of further analysis.

## üïπÔ∏è Usage
To run the script, save it to a Python file (e.g., suricata_report_generator.py) and execute it in a terminal or command prompt with Python.

The script will read event data from the 'eve.json' file, generate the report, and save it as 'report.html' in the same directory.

```
python suricata_report_generator.py
```

## üìù Prerequisites
Python 3.x: The script is written in Python 3 and requires a compatible interpreter to run.
Download and install Python 3.x from https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Required Libraries: The script uses the following external libraries, which must be installed:

-   pandas
-   plotly
-   tqdm

To install these libraries, run the following command:

```
 pip install pandas plotly tqdm
```

Suricata JSON Output: The script expects input in the form of Suricata's JSON output format.
Ensure that the 'eve.json' file is available in the same directory as the script, or modify the script to read from a different file path.

After completing these prerequisites, the script is ready to be executed. 
The generated HTML report provides an overview of Suricata events, enabling security professionals to analyze network traffic, detect anomalies, and respond to potential threats.
